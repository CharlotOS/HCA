# HCA - Highly Compressed Archive Utility  
  
Version: 0.6.0  
  
---  
  
## Overview  
  
HCA is a command-line utility to compress and extract folders/files into a highly compressed archive format (`.hca`).    
It supports multi-threaded compression, AES-256 encryption with password, split archives, deletion of original files after compression (with confirmations), and detailed metadata.  
  
---  
  
## Features  
  
- Compress entire folders with multi-threading for speed.  
- Extract archives with integrity checks.  
- List contents and metadata of archives.  
- AES-256 password encryption/decryption.  
- Split archives into 50MB parts for easier handling.  
- Confirmed deletion of original files after successful compression.  
- Safe filename enforcement.  
- Detailed progress and messages.  
- Manual (`--man`), help (`--help`), and summary (`--tldr`) commands.  
- Version information display.  
- Error codes for scripting.

## Requirements  
  
- Python 3.7+  
- `pycryptodome` library (`pip install pycryptodome`)

| `--split`                   | Split archive into 50MB parts (`.part1`, `.part2`, etc.) |  
| `--version`                 | Show program version                                     |

## Examples  
  
Compress a folder with password, split archive, and delete original files:  

```bash  
python hca.py --compress myfolder --output backup.hca --password --split --delete  
```  
  
Extract an encrypted archive:  
  
```bash  
python hca.py --extract backup.hca --output extracted_folder --password  
```  
  
List archive contents:  
    
```bash  
python hca.py --list backup.hca  
```  

Show version:  
  
```bash  
python hca.py --version  
```  
  
Show manual/help:  
  
```bash  
python hca.py --help  
```  
  
---  
  
## Notes  
  
* Only filenames with letters, digits, dash, underscore, dot, and spaces are supported for safety.  
* Password encryption uses AES-256-CBC.  
* Splitting creates multiple files named like `backup.hca.part1`, `backup.hca.part2`, etc.  
* During deletion, the tool asks twice before removing each file.  
* Metadata includes creator user, creation timestamp, file count, and archive version.  
* Multi-threading uses up to 4 threads for compression workers.

## Building Windows Executable (.exe)  
  
To build a standalone Windows executable using PyInstaller:  
  
1. Install PyInstaller:  
  
```bash  
pip install pyinstaller  
```  
  
2. Run:  
  
```bash  
pyinstaller --onefile hca.py  
```  
  
3. The executable will be in the `dist` folder as `hca.exe`.
